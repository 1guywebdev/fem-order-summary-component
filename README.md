## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- @media queries

### What I learned

I've learned about placing and sizing the background image with 
```
```css
.element {
  background-size: ;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
```
To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
